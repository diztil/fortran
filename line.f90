! This program computes the slope-intercept form of a line based on
! coordinates that are input by the user. Also, it identifies if a
! line is vertical or horizontal

! PROCESSING THE DATA
! Deciding beforehand whether the line is vertical or horizontal, in order to avoid certain errors like dividing over zero for the case where the difference of the x coordinates is zero
   IF (abs(y2) - abs(y1) == 0) THEN
      PRINT *, "Line is horizontal"
      WRITE (*,'(a,f9.5)') "Equation: y =", y1
   ELSE IF (abs(x2) - abs(x1) == 0) THEN
      PRINT *, "Line is vertical"

! We know the standard "general" equation for a line is
! y = mx + b
